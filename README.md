## Twitter Topic Analysis

### Overview
In this project, we conducted comprehensive analysis of data obtained from the Twitter Developer API. We employed exploratory data analysis techniques and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling to extract prominent topics from the Twitter dataset.

### Key Features
- Utilized Twitter Developer API data
- Employed exploratory data analysis techniques
- Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling
- Extracted 9 prominent topics out of 50 generated by LDA

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluated LDA model performance with a coherence score of 0.525 and a perplexity score of -17
- Analyzed potential biases in data and limitations in LDA model interpretation

## Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

### Overview
In this project, we focused on sentiment analysis of tweets related to COVID-19. We cleaned the text data, performed tokenization, stemming, and removal of common stop words. We then trained Naive Bayes models to classify tweet sentiment.

### Key Features
- Utilized Twitter dataset containing about 45,000 COVID-19 related tweets
- Cleaned text data through tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal
- Trained Naive Bayes models for sentiment classification
- Achieved a test accuracy of 69.67%
